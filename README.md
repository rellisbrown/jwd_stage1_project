# JWD - End of Stage 1 Project - Rupert Ellis brown

## Getting started

After cloning the repository to a local development environment, the application can be run using the following script:

### `npm run start`

In order to retrieve the correct data, the appropriate Qlik Sense app needs to be running (by default, 'JWD_PYW' under 'JWD Project' within the Calibrate Qlik Sense Hub).

## Explore

The application encompasses a dashboard providing key information on revenue, expenses and profit associated with a list of sales representatives. 

Selections can be made on one more sales representative using the drop down list located at the top right corner of the page.

The charts in the application will update their figures according to the selection that has been made, with the default state representing the sum of the data from all sales representatives.
